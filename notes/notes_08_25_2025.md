- topological space of boundary states
- topological space of latent states

- traversal across boundary states must necessarily be compressed, or else no learning
- in general case, consider topological vector space since they can be continuous or discrete

- brain maps the tangent bundle of action space?
- action space is the space of events -- field values at a spacetime location
- roughly, for q = (x, t), concatenation of [q, $\phi(q)$] = $\gamma$

- at a point $\gamma$ in $\Gamma$, the tangent space depicts possible changes in DOFs around
