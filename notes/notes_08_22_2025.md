- map of the space of action
- each action is sorted by context
- similar actions in similar contexts
- each 0-simplex is an event
- some set of observables at some spatiotemporal location
- (x,t) and $\phi(x,t)$
- there's a simultaneous learning of both the domain and the field values over the domain
- the learning/latent inference estimates field values at domain locations not directly observable
- this requires understanding the dynamics of field values

- on each step, the algorithm must predict a domain (a topology) and the field
  values over domain

- a simultaneous discrete and continuous search
- directed simplex is a program
  - each node is a transformation, more accurately, a generator
